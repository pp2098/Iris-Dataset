# Iris-Dataset
The main objective is to predict the species type specifically "Iris Virginica" on the basis of different features like sepal_length,sepal_width,petal_lenght, and petal_width.
In the data cleaning no outliers treatment is done because it is a prediction problem and after treatement all models throwing accuracy of 100%, which is found to be suspecisious.
After the data visualization step, model building step is done for this Logistic Regression, Decision Tree,Random Forest,Support Vector Machine and K-Nearest Neighbor models are used.
The accuracy score is and the best fit moodel is found and name as Logistic Regression Model and SVM model with 100% accuracy and the best fit model
